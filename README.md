Hello, my name is Beibarys and I am a backend developer with experience in fullstack development. 
I am proficient in Python and JavaScript, making me a valuable asset for any company in need of a developer with these skills.
In addition to my technical abilities, I am also a quick learner and am always open to expanding my skill set. 
My knowledge of technologies such as RESTful APIs, database management, and Git makes me a strong candidate for any backend or fullstack development position. 
I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a new company and contribute to the success of their projects.
